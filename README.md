# ss-steams

## Installation
`npm install'

## Setup
change the ports in `ss-config.json`

## Fire it Up
`npm start`

## Caveats
If you're going to run on localhost, you may have to do some configuration since the ports have to be different for each server. I built using my vps so I was able to bypass this issue.
